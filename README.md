# History of AI

ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Llama, and many more have gripped the tech world for last couple of years. Where did it all begin? Combining the curiosity for AI and love for history in my new project: tracing history of AI!

## The process

I am building this as I read articles, books, watch lectures and so on. As such, I imagine this being a loooooong project always in making and almost never built in chronological order. To start with, I will just add events as I learn about them in descending order of chronology. At some point, maybe we can group it by year. But let's not worry about that just yet.

With so many AI products coming up everyday in last 2 years, including them in the history will make it too heavy in recency in my opinion. It makes more sense to include events that turned out to be major milestones in pushing this technology/trend/hype forward or setbacks that stalled it longer.

Alright, here we go! Los gehts!
